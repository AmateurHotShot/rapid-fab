            <p>The idea came from talking with my wife about keeping our keys in one place. If we could just throw them at a target, it would be great if it could be caught and dropped for us. After talking with some people, we thought electromagnets

            <h3 class="mb-0">Making a Wooden Tie</h3>
            <div class="mb-3">Turns out there is more than one way to laser cut a tie. Looking online, I found a few good examples, and there are 2 types of wooden ties that I want to try.</div>
            <h5 class="mb-1">The "Wooden Book" Method</h5>
            <div>This one cuts small seams along the tie, then cuts the outline. It's a similar method to making flexible wooden books. </div>
            <div class="mb-3">The settings for cutting the wood were pretty simple. It was full power at a slightly slower speed than normal. I'd love to try this same pattern with metal in the future, but that might be for another time</div>
            <div class="mb-3">After this VERY successful first attempt, I think I'm going to stick with the wooden book method. I'm having a full sized version cut out at the ECEn lab at BYU.</div>
            <h5 class="mb-1">The Sectioned Method</h5>
            <div class="hb-3">Happy little accidents happen, and that is exactly what became of my full sized attempt. The lab I sent the svg file to didn't cut the small cuts, and also cut acryllic instead of wood, so I just have the full tie as one big plastic piece. What this means is that I can try the sectioned method, and possibly make it incredibly cool.</div>
            <div class="hb-3">What I'm going to do is cut the tie horizontally into even sections, and put el wire through the perimiter of the tie, keeping it from falling apart and also making it glow. Then I'm going to etch the tie with a paisly design, so that the light will show up in the etched, scruffed up parts. I might combine this with the circut project this next week.</div>
